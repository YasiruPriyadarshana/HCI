                <img src="assets/img/GD.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid">
                <p>Graphic designers are a motley lot and come with varying interests, goals and passions. Some are artistic and creative, while others have more of analytical approach to their design style. No matter what type of personality a student has, the graphic design field has room for, and often benefits from, different visual and creative perspectives. But, it is important for graphic designers to have an eye for color, design and typography as these are often crucial to becoming an effective designer.</p>

                <h3>Painting/Printmaking</h3>
                <p class="font-italic">The undergraduate curriculum enables students to adopt a specialized focus within the discipline and use elective options to pursue other areas of interest in the School of the Arts, the university and the community. </p>
                <img src="assets/img/paint.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid">
                <p>The programme aims to equip students with the necessary skills and expertise to realise their full creative potential and to pursue a career in the visual arts or other chosen professions. Each year is designed to ensure that it builds upon the previous year in terms of content, skill development and individual research.  Students are provided with a sound knowledge of the theory and practice of their subject before developing personal study paths and self-motivated programmes of work in the final year.</p>

                <img src="assets/img/photography.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid">
                <p>Photographers capture professional-quality photographs. Most use digital cameras as opposed to film cameras. Because digital cameras are electronic, photos taken on them can be stored and transported on portable memory devices and edited using computer software. Photographers may use a variety of editing techniques, such as cropping the photo or enlarging the image, or applying filters to make the photo lighter, darker or sharper.</p>

                <p class="font-italic">Sculpture is much more than grand statues carved out of marble. In fact, any three-dimensional piece of art is sculpture. That includes everything from thousand-year-old Mayan figures to towering hunks of metal to discarded household objects put together in a way that makes a statement about gender roles.</p>
                <img src="assets/img/sculpture.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid">
                <p>Whether or not you’ve had experience working with materials such as wood or metal, you’ll probably be required to take an introductory wood and metal practice course. You’ll learn how to work in wood, using band saws, table saws, planers, and sanders. For metalwork, you’ll use band saws, grinding tools, benders and rollers, and welders. By the time the semester ends, you’ll know how to use these tools safely to create art. </p>

              Artists and designers of unusual promise and strong motivation are provided an educational context in which they can explore the potential of their own talents in the midst of an intense critical dialogue. This dialogue is generated by their peers, by distinguished visitors, and by a faculty comprised of professional artists of acknowledged accomplishment.
              The graduate student’s primary educational experience at Yale is centered on the student’s own studio activity. Supporting this enterprise are the experience, knowledge, and skills gained from rigorous, structured courses such as drawing, filmmaking, the relativity of color, and the rich academic offerings found throughout Yale. Each student is routinely exposed to many aesthetic positions through encounters with faculty members and visitors. The School is devoted not only to the refinement of visual skills, but also to the cultivation of the mind. Students must bring creative force and imagination to their own development, for these qualities cannot be taught—they can only be stimulated and appreciated.
